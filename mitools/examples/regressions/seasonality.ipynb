    "This notebook illustrates the use of `MSTL` [1] to decompose a time series into a: trend component, multiple seasonal components, and a residual component. MSTL uses STL (Seasonal-Trend decomposition using LOESS) to iteratively extract seasonal components from a time series. The key inputs into `MSTL` are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `periods` - The period of each seasonal component (e.g., for hourly data with daily and weekly seasonality we would have: `periods=(24, 24*7)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `windows` - The lengths of each seasonal smoother with respect to each period. If these are large then the seasonal component will show less variability over time. Must be odd. If `None` a set of default values determined by experiments in the original paper [1] are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `lmbda` - The lambda parameter for a Box-Cox transformation prior to decomposition. If `None` then no transformation is done. If `\"auto\"` then an appropriate value for lambda is automatically selected from the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `iterate` - Number of iterations to use to refine the seasonal component.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `stl_kwargs` - All the other parameters which can be passed to STL (e.g., `robust`, `seasonal_deg`, etc.). See [STL docs](https://www.statsmodels.org/dev/generated/statsmodels.tsa.seasonal.STL.html).\n",

    "\n",
    "Note there are some key differences in this implementation to 1. Missing data must be handled outside of the `MSTL` class. The algorithm proposed in the paper handles a case when there is no seasonality. This implementation assumes that there is at least one seasonal component.\n",
